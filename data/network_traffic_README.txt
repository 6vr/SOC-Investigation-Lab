*** File: network_traffic.pcap ***

üìå Why this file is included as a placeholder:

This file is a **placeholder**, not an actual PCAP file.

Real PCAP files are often:
- Large in size
- Contain complex packet data
- Include potentially sensitive or identifying network information

For those reasons, real PCAPs are **not suitable for public sharing** without thorough sanitization.

‚û°Ô∏è You can replace this file with a real, safe-to-share `.pcap` file for deeper analysis using Wireshark or similar tools.
